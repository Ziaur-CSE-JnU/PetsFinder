# This workflow uses CodeQL to perform static analysis on the codebase.
# CodeQL is a tool from GitHub that scans your code and finds potential vulnerabilities and errors.
# This workflow is triggered on push to main and develop branches, on pull requests to main, and on a schedule.

    # The matrix strategy allows you to run jobs on multiple versions of a language, operating system, or any other set of parameters.
    # In this case, the job will run once for each item in the 'language' array. Since there's only one item ('python'), the job will run once.
    # The 'fail-fast: false' option means that all jobs will run to completion, even if one fails.
